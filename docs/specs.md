# AIRO - Project Overview

**AIRO** is a fictional company with the goal of developing a scalable, interactive online platform where users can create, customize, and compete with AI-driven bots in virtual arenas.

## Key Features

### 1. User Registration and Authentication
- **Tiers**: Free, Paid, and Enterprise.
- **Enterprise tier**: Companies can use pre-trained AI data created by consumer users.
    - Example: *ANYbotics* (a multi-tenant model) allows Active Directory integration where enterprise users can:
        - Purchase bots (e.g., "Anymal") and train them.
        - Link existing bots and integrate with AI simulators.
    - Includes an **AI data store** for advanced users to access and leverage AI models.

### 2. Bot Creation and Customization
- **Store**: Users can buy bots or individual bot parts for customization.

### 3. AI Behavior Programming
- **Browser-based programming**: Users can program AI behaviors directly in the browser.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: For uploading and managing behaviors externally.
  
- **AI & Machine Learning Integration**:
    - **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Allows advanced users to implement RL algorithms where bots learn optimal strategies through trial and error.
    - **Neural Networks**: Users can train and deploy simple neural networks to control bot behavior based on environmental inputs.

- **Advanced Analytics**:
    - Offer detailed performance reports, strategy recommendations, and AI insights for users looking to optimize their bots.
    - **Premium**: Subscription fee for access to advanced analytics features.

### 4. Virtual Arena Creation and Event Management
- **Pro Tier**: Available for users who want more control over arenas and event management.
- **Live Streaming**: Stream events live via YouTube using its API.
- **Arena Creation**: Provide tools for game designers to create and manage arenas.
- **Leaderboards**: Track top-performing bots.
- **Event Complexity**: Events vary in strategy and gameplay, offering users diverse challenges.

### 5. Payment Processing
- Supports **subscriptions** and **in-app purchases** for bots, bot parts, and event participation.

### 6. Event Notifications and Reminders
- Automatic notifications for upcoming events and challenges.

### 7. 3D Content Rendering
- High-quality 3D rendering of bots and arenas for a visually immersive experience.
