1) All projects should follow this naming convention:
	
	airo-<<PROJECT_NAME>>-<<TYPE>>
	
	For instance: 
		airo-users-gateway-api, where "users" is the project name and "gateway-api" is the type
		airo-enterprise-gateway-api
		airo-events-microservice
		airo-users-frontend
		
	For testing:
		Create project under the "Tests" solution folder and name the project according to the rule:
			airo-<<PROJECT_NAME>>-tests
		
		for instance: airo-purchase-tests
		
2) All gateway-api(s) projects should be exposed in the 3000 range

3) All microservice(s) projects should be exposed in the 4000 range

4) All front-end(s) projects should be exposed in the 5000 range

5) RabbitMq
	<<MICROSERVICE_NAME>>-exchange, e.g. invoice-exchange
	<<MICROSERVICE_NAME>>-queue, e.g. invoice-queue
	
	<<MESSAGE_NAME>>Message e.g, InvoiceCreatedMessage
	
6) Keep mermaid architecture diagrams up-to-date when modifying the dependencies
