<h2 mat-dialog-title>Welcome to AIRO - Pre-Alpha Version!</h2>

<mat-dialog-content>
  <p>Thank you for joining us as we test and refine <strong>AIRO</strong>. As we’re still in the pre-alpha stage, please
    be aware that the platform is in active development, and occasional <strong>data wipes</strong> may occur. This
    means that your data (such as bot behaviours or progress) may be reset periodically as we test new
    features, implement changes, or fix bugs.</p>

  <p><strong>What to expect:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Instability</strong>: The platform may experience occasional downtime or slow performance as we make
      improvements.</li>
    <li><strong>Bugs</strong>: You may encounter unexpected behaviors or errors. We’re working hard to address them.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data Wipes</strong>: Your data may be erased from time to time during this early phase. We recommend not
      relying on the current data for important or long-term purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Missing Features</strong>: Some features are still under development and may not be fully functional or
      available.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We appreciate your understanding as we make these necessary updates. Your feedback is crucial to improving the
    platform, so if you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please report them via <a
      href="https://github.com/righettig/AIRO/issues">feedback form/support link</a>.</p>

  <p>Thank you for being part of this early journey with us!</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> We’ll be making regular updates, so expect frequent changes and improvements. Stay tuned for
    new features and enhancements!</p>
