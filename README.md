# AIRO - Artificial Intelligence & Robotics Online

## AI-Powered Online Gaming Platform

This project is a scalable, microservices-based online gaming platform built on Microsoft Azure. The platform allows users to create, customize, and program AI-driven bots to compete in resource-gathering and survival events within virtual arenas.

### Key Features:
User Authentication & Management: Secure registration and login system with role-based access for free and paid tiers.
Bot Management: Create and customize AI bots with a flexible behavior design system supporting multiple programming languages.
Arena Management: Virtual arenas for events, designed and managed by game designers.
Event Execution: Asynchronous, real-time event processing, capable of handling a large number of bots.
Microservices Architecture: Deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with API management, service bus communication, and integrated monitoring.

### Tech Stack:
Backend: Node.js, .NET Core, Docker, Kubernetes (AKS)
Frontend: React, Vue.js
Database: Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database
Messaging: Azure Service Bus
Monitoring & Logging: Azure Monitor, Application Insights

This prototype is a foundation for a highly scalable and extensible gaming platform, focusing on performance, security, and user experience.
